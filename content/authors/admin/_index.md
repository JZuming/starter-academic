Zu-Ming Jiang is now a Master's Degree Candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, supervised by Professor Shi-Min Hu. His major research interests include Fuzzing and System Software Reliablity. 

His works focus on developing systematic and effective fuzzing framework which can detect bugs hidding in various kinds of program execution situations, including error handling and thread interleaving. He has found hundred of bugs in Linux kernel modules like XFS file system and user-space programs like SQLite. He has published three papers in international conferences, including two first-author papers published in ISSRE and USENIX Security.
